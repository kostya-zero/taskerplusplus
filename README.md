# Tasker++

A better minimalist tasks manager.

This project is a rewrite of my old C project called [tasker](https://github.com/kostya-zero/tasker) into C++ language.
By the way, it's made for learning the C++ language, not for the actual use.

### Roadmap 

- [x] `add` command
- [x] `list` command
- [x] `remove` command
- [x] `check` command
- [ ] Rewrite error handling with `tl::expected`
- [ ] Setup GitHub Action builds
- [ ] Better CLI visuals
- [ ] Use a better error handling solution
